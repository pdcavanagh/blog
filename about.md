I am computer engineer and geologist currently pursuing my PhD at Indiana University. My goal is to return to a technical role as a software developer for an Indianapolis-based company. I aim to use my skills to contribute to an organization that is pushing the boundaries of software development, utilizing both web and mobile technologies.

I am currently seeking software development opportunities at a passionate cutting-edge tech company that supports creativity, health, and giving back to the local community.

Today marks the beginning of my journey into Jekyll and employing a Ruby-based static site generator. When I started coding my first web pages, static sites were the norm. As I begin to dig into the modern age of web and mobile apps, I am amazed by the diversity of technologies and the capabilities since the early days of the web. Equally impressive are the tools that are available to pure design oriented individuals allowing them to customize a deeply fulfilling experience of the web, both aesthetically and mechanically. 

This is another start, or rather a continuation, and with that there will be bumps, bruises, and triumphs. I've said it a hundred times and here's to a thousand more: 

{% highlight python %}
print 'Hello, world!'
#=> prints 'Hello, world' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

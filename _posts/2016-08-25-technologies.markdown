As I have begun commiting to developing an expertise in web development, I am suddenly faced with the opportunity to explore so many technologies I've only been familiar with in passing. Slowly I'm stripping away the mystery of these acronyms and enjoying every minute.

Obviously, the first place I started was ramping up with HTML and CSS, again. Mind you HTML has changed quite a bit since I was first making static web sites, but the boiler plate tags have remained the same. This part was relatively straight forward. As for CSS, this too was a skillset I had, but it seems the stylesheets have grown to an almost unmanagable size. This lead me to looking into Sass, but I'll have to post on that later once I have more to share.

Currently, I've been spending my time ramping up with JavaScript. I've had to create some 'project' sites to test out my skills. In particular, I've been focusing on developing a working knowledge of three technologies and/or frameworks:

1. [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
2. [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)
3. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

I started with the front-end technologies because they were easier to demo and quickly implement. I wanted to hone my skills in the design aspect of development and felt these two technologies were popular and desired skills. jQuery has been fascinating learning about and really opened my eyes to the reality of how modern browsers are interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model) and jQuery's core abilities. In particular, I loved the aspect of being able to traverse the DOM and manipulate it without reloading. This is probably a concept that's been around for awhile and no longer novel, but it was thrilling to discover.

AngularJS has a whole other level of capability that I am slowly peeling away. The concept of interspersed JavaScript with HTML and the implementation of directives really makes the ability to create a client-side web application a breeze. I am looking forward to seeing how AngularJS fits into the full stack development scheme and especially the MEAN stack. 

As for the back-end technologies, these I felt much less intimidated. I have plenty of experience in more tradition software development, mainly stemming from work on embedded systems and scientific computing. Coding in functional or object-oriented fashions doesn't phase me and I suspect the transition to ramping up on the back-end technologies will go more smoothly than front-end. I'll post more on Node.js in an upcoming article.
